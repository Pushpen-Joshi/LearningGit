hello how did it happened
i have no clue
still how to get this vim command file to insert mode
to save the file i know its :wp after an esc command
to quit its :q! 
but how to get it to insert mode still am having confusion
and also i am able to touch type with my left hand properly but in my right hand am still confusing
maybe this weekend i have to work on the type master again to get my right hand also like left hand
maybe this is because of the extra keys on the right side 
still have to work on the number typing
also i am liking to type on this particular keyboard
`sorry its not :wp to quit its :wq
`
